1. How 1 DSC is pegged to $1?
   When a user deposits a collateral, for eg wETH
   By using chainlink pricefeeds we can get what is the value of 1wETH in USD
   If value of 1wETH in USD is $2000
   Then a person can mint a max of 2000 DSC coins, because price of 1DSC coin is $1

2. Can I deploy my own wETH contract?
