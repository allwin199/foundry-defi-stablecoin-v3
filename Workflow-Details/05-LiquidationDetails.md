price of 1ETH in $2000

let's say we have deposited 0.5ETH
value of 0.5ETH in USD is $1000
Now we have collateral worth $1000

Always a user should have 200% overcollateralized

since we have $1000 worth of ETH we can maximum mint $500 of DSC
100% 0f 500 is 500; 200% of 500 is 1000

If we mint $500 DSC after depositing $1000 worth of ETH
Our DSC balance will be $500

---

If price of 1 ETH tanks to $1000

we have a 0.5ETH collateral.
value of 0.5ETH in USD is $500 now.
Our updated collateral value in USD is $500.

Right now we have $500 of DSC backed by $500 worth of ETH

This user is a bad user!
This user has to be liquidated!

---

If someone liquidated this bad user. They will get 10% liquidation bonus

for eg: the bad users debt is $500 worth of ETH
right now ETH price is $1000

therfore this user's debt in ETH is 0.5
debt in USD is $500

If someone pays this 0.5 ETH on behalf of the bad user. They will get 10% bonus.
10% of 0.5 = 0.05

By paying 0.5 ETH, the liquidator is getting 0.55 ETH

---

Once the liquidator pays the 0.5ETH in collateral, the debt from the bad user will be burnt and then the liquidator will get the money back.
